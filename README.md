# multi-level-adc-HDL-driver
I created this driver for (AFE) ADC bought from Maximintegrated company named Santa Fe. The inputs to this AFE can vary +/- 10 V. Throughput for one channel is around 115 samples/second. The output also could be used for micro controllers or FPGA such as Zedboardboards.
