# multi-level-ADC-HDL-driver
I created this driver for (AFE) ADC bought from Maximintegrated company, SANTA FE (MAXREFDES5#). Inputs to this AFE can vary from -10V to + 10 V. Throughput for one channel is around 115K samples/second. The digital output also could be used for micro controllers or FPGAs such as Zedboardboard.
